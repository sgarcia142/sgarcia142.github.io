<p>Hello there! I'm Stephen, a dedicated and experienced data analyst with a passion for transforming complex data into compelling narratives. At 53, I bring a wealth of life experience and a fresh academic background, having graduated magna cum laude with a degree in Computer Science, concentrating in Data Science, from the University of Texas at San Antonio in 2021. My educational journey is ongoing as I am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics.</p> 

<p>I have honed my skills in <b>SQL</b>, <b>Python</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>Tableau</b>, and <b>Power BI</b>, and I thrive on turning data-driven insights into actionable strategies. My unique perspective combines both practical experience and cutting-edge academic knowledge, allowing me to uncover hidden patterns, solve intricate problems, and support decision-making processes with precision and clarity.</p>

<p>When I'm not diving into data sets, I cherish spending time with my wonderful wife and our two adorable Pugs, CoCo and Percy. I also enjoy our annual trip to Colorado where we spend time with family, hike, and fish in the beautiful Rocky Mountains. Let's connect and explore how we can harness the power of data together!</p>

## Education

<p>My journey into the world of technology began with a passion for self-teaching. Driven by curiosity and a desire to understand how the digital world worked, I started learning web development on my own. This self-driven education opened the door to an exciting career opportunity with AT&T in 2001, where I spent the next ten years honing my skills and making significant contributions.</p>

<p>As the tech landscape evolved, so did my interests. I found myself drawn to the burgeoning field of data engineering, and I decided to pivot within AT&T to explore this new passion. The thirst for knowledge and the realization of the importance of formal education led me back to academia in 2017. I returned to the University of Texas at San Antonio, determined to deepen my understanding and formalize my expertise.</p>

<p>Balancing work and studies, I embarked on a rigorous academic journey, ultimately earning a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a concentration in Data Science in 2021. Graduating magna cum laude was a testament to my dedication and perseverance, and it reaffirmed my commitment to continuous learning.</p>

<p>Not one to rest on my laurels, I am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics at UTSA. This advanced degree is a part of my ongoing evolution towards a data-centric career, equipping me with the tools and knowledge to tackle complex data challenges and contribute to the field's growth.</p>
